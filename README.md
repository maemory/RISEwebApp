RISE Web-Interface
==========

This was a project performed during the Stanford RISE internship program in 2014. The goal of the project was to create a browser-based interface for applications run on a local machine. This comprises the work of Bryan Tan, with mentorship by Michael Emory.

The code is hosted in the `gh-pages` branch.
