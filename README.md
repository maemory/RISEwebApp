##JoeInputCreator
This is an input form which uses javascript to transform the input fields into a formatted text file. This formatted file is representative of the CFD code input files used at Stanford for the code [`JOE`](https://github.com/psaap/mum). The file can then be saved locally to the user's machine. The page leverages jQuery and Bootstrap 3.0.

##Sinusoid
This page is a first attempt at simple browser-based post-processing using `D3.js`. Data can be uploaded from a user's local machine, and then manipulated and visualized through D3.
